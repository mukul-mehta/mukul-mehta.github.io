## Hello World!

After procrastinating on fixing my website for months, I've decided to go with [this theme](https://github.com/janbaudisch/zola-sam) and the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) static site generator. I was using Hugo before and IMHO the layout and code organization was complex and not exactly easy to use and modify. I was looking for other options and a senior of mine, [Xypnox](https://www.xypnox.com/blag/) migrated his amazing blag (Make sure to check it out!) to Zola. He had a pretty good experience with it and wrote a [post](https://www.xypnox.com/blag/posts/migrating-to-zola/) outlining the process and his experience. I was impressed with how easy it was to get started and make changes to theme and decided to move to Zola

I loved the Sam theme since it was very minimal and incredibly easy to customise. I made a couple of design changes to it thanks to a friend - [Rashil](https://rashil2000.me) and got this new blog up and running!

So yeah, after months of deciding what theme to go with, messing around with the little frontend knowledge I have and switching between the endless SSGs out there, here we are!

I plan to blog about programming, software dev, open source and random 3 AM thoughts. Hopefully I'll be regular in maintaining this blog!
