# Yo!

For any bug out there, Stack Overflow and random blogposts from 2012 are our best friends. Since a lot of it gets lost, I'm planning to post little bits of information I learnt from StackOverflow, blogs and random exploration. This section was inspired by a senior of mine, Sangeet Mishra started it on his [blog](https://sangeetmishra.in/til/) and I loved the idea!
